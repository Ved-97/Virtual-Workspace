# Virtual-Workspace
This was the project that was completed and contributed by me during my education as graduate in Bachelor of Computer Science Engineering.

Project “Virtual Workspace” is based on the new and revolutionary concept where people will be able to construct or edit their own 3d models in Augmented Reality thus creating their own workspace for them to make imaginative objects.

●	The service is based on an Android Application.

●	Users can construct their real life objects into virtual object using their smartphone.

●	Innovators can place 3D objects according to their need before purchasing the actual product.

●	Android Application will guide the users about their surroundings.

The special feature of this set of functionalities is to give user a creative environment where one can interact with virtual objects in real time as if it is just one of the real objects. The fact that one can manipulate an object which does not even exist in real is a really interesting concept and is gaining a lot of attention worldwide.
