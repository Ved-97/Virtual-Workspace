# Virtual-Workspace
This was the project that was completed and contributed by me during my education as graduate in Bachelor of Computer Science Engineering.

Project “Virtual Workspace” is based on the new and revolutionary concept where people will be able to construct or edit their own 3d models in Augmented Reality thus creating their own workspace for them to make imaginative objects.

●	The service is based on an Android Application.

●	Users can construct their real life objects into virtual object using their smartphone.

●	Innovators can place 3D objects according to their need before purchasing the actual product.

●	Android Application will guide the users about their surroundings.

The special feature of this set of functionalities is to give user a creative environment where one can interact with virtual objects in real time as if it is just one of the real objects. The fact that one can manipulate an object which does not even exist in real is a really interesting concept and is gaining a lot of attention worldwide.

Aims and Objectives of the Project:

The aim and some of the main objectives of the project are listed below. These objectives are the main driving force for solving the issues and problems which we pointed out in the previous section.

●	PROVIDE A TOOL TO CREATE 3D OBJECTS EASILY

One can create 3 dimensional objects easily on the go without any prior programming knowledge. This can be a dynamic tool for most of the creative heads. 


●	HELP VISUALIZE THINGS EASILY

It can help a person to try on new things and by trial and error he can finally reach an appropriate visualization of the creation he wants to implement.


●	UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS ACTUALLY WORK
A student can be very much learn from a moving model rather than a still picture. This could make understanding concepts efficient as well a fun enough to spark the curiosity within.


●	DEFINE AN ENVIRONMENT WHILE NOT CHANGING IT
While decorating a room, one won’t be needing to shift furniture just to try on a new arrangement. A simple manipulation of desired objects on a swipe would make things much simpler.


●	PRESENTING A PRODUCT WHICH IS YET TO BE DEVELOPED
An employee of a product based company can fetch contracts from his clients by detailing the product he wants to sell to them. This can be done by showing him same product through this method in real time, impressing the clients with solid creation.


●	DESIGNING SOMETHING UNIQUE OUT OF IMAGINATION
The more one practices creating things, the more he is able to extend his creativity.  


The following are the technologies which are used in our Project:

1.	AndroidStudio is the Official IDE for Android. Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.

2.	Unity, the world's leading real-time engine, is used to create half of the world's games.

3.	Vuforia is an augmented reality software development kit for mobile devices that enables the creation of augmented reality applications.
